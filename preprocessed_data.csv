"Analyzing the demographics of patients with uveitis in an indigent, urban population | BMC Ophthalmology | Full Text",BMC Ophthalmology,1,"Purpose
To study the types of uveitis examined in a hospital serving indigent populations in need of low-cost care.
Methods
A retrospective chart review examined the electronic medical records of all patients with uveitis-related at Drexel Eye Physicians. Data collected included demographics, anatomic location of the uveitis, systemic disease associations, treatment modalities and insurance. Statistical analysis was performed using χ² or Fischer exact tests.
Results
270 patients (366 eyes) were included for analysis, 67% of patients identified as African American. Most eyes (95.3%, N = 349) were treated with topical corticosteroid drops, and only 6 (1.6%) received an intravitreal implant. Immunosuppressive medications were started in 24 patients (8.9%). Nearly 80% depended to some extent on Medicare or Medicaid Assistance for treatment coverage. There was no association between insurance type and use of biologics or difluprednate.
Conclusion
We found no association between insurance type and the prescription of medications for uveitis that should be used at home. There was a minimal number of patients prescribed medications for implantation in the office. The adherence of use of medications at home should be investigated.","A retrospective chart review examined the electronic medical records of all patients with uveitis-related at Drexel Eye Physicians.

The side effects of these medications can vary and require recurrent lab monitoring and long-term ophthalmic follow-up [3]. Adding together the healthcare expenses associated with the medications, phlebotomy, and recurrent office visits, the long term management of uveitis can carry a high cost [4,5,6]. This may effectively eliminate more expensive drugs as treatment options for financially constrained patient populations [4,5,6]. One study assessed this cost using a large administrative claims database in the United States [7]. They found that in patients with the highest costs associated with treatment of non-infectious uveitis, the average annual total health care expenditure ranged from $59,873 to $349,967 during the 9 year study period [7]. In the Multicenter Uveitis and Steroid Treatment (MUST) trial, the combined cost of medications, surgeries, intravitreal implants, and hospital care was found to be $69,300 in patients receiving the fluocinolone implant for bilateral disease versus $52,500 for patients receiving systemic treatment with immunosuppressive agents [8].Only one study has explored the impact of medication cost on adherence in patients with uveitis [9]. This study specifically looked at adherence barriers in a sample of pediatric patients. The literature on medication selection by the treating physician based on cost has disparate conclusions depending on the anatomic location of uveitis being treated, which ranges from no effect to strictly choosing therapy based on price [10,11,12]. Understanding that there are financial constraints to treatment and adherence in patients with uveitis is only half of the problem. Practically speaking, how do we limit the cost of eye drops and systemic immunosuppressive agents to provide affordable treatments which promote adherence in patients with chronic uveitis?Currently, there are no studies that identified strategies to limit healthcare costs associated with medications in indigent populations requiring low-cost care for the treatment of uveitis. Drexel Eye Physicians (DEP) was an academic ophthalmology practice affiliated with the safety net hospital, Hahnemann University Hospital (HUH). HUH served the primarily uninsured, Medicaid, and Medicare population in Central Philadelphia [13, 14]. With operating costs outstripping the reimbursement rate, Hahnemann University Hospital had amassed a monthly loss of 3–5 million dollars and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection [14].Prior to the closure of HUH and the DEP in September 2019, we examined the uveitides seen to understand the treatments needed for control of ocular inflammation. We concurrently analyzed patient insurance plans and eye drop copays to assess prescribing practices used to decrease treatment cost."
